Sound FX Pack 1 is a growing set of sounds effects in .wav format designed from the ground up for use in your games, music, videos or anything else you want to use them for, royalty free. 

You can use them in confidence of the source as all audio chains are backed up proving they are original sounds designed by myself. 

Starting with some of the most simplest arcade style sounds, more Sound FX will be added each and every week, feel free to request new sounds using the comments on https://edwardcufaude.itch.io/soundfxpack1
and I'll try to add some in the next update.
